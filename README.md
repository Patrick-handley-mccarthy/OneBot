# OneBot

One bot to rule them all, one bot to find them,
One bot to bring them all, and in the Discord bind them.

OneBot is a master technical administration bot designed for IT-inclined users to easily manage large communities and complex bot ecosystems, primarily on Discord. It aims to provide a centralized platform for controlling and orchestrating various bots, simplifying administration and enhancing overall management.

## Project Goals

*   Provide a core framework for building and managing bot ecosystems, primarily focused on Discord.
*   Offer a wrapper for integrating existing Discord bots into the OneBot platform.
*   Serve as a template for creating new Discord-compatible bots within the OneBot framework.
*   Simplify complex Discord bot administration tasks.

## Planned Features (To be expanded)

*   Centralized Discord bot management interface.
*   Modular architecture for easy extensibility and future support for other platforms (connectors).
*   Advanced logging and monitoring capabilities specific to Discord interactions.
*   Role and permission management across Discord bots.
*   User profile management for cross-server settings and personalization.

## Bot Types

OneBot manages two types of bots:

*   **Managed Bots:** These are existing bots that are integrated into OneBot through wrappers. OneBot controls their operation and provides a unified interface for managing them.
*   **Integrated Bots:** These are bots specifically designed to be part of the OneBot ecosystem. They leverage OneBot's core functionality and APIs for seamless integration.

## User Profile Management

OneBot will include a user profile management system to allow users to store and manage their settings across different servers. This will enable features such as cross-server role persistence and personalized bot behavior. More details will be provided as the design is finalized.
